## How it works

The project aims to design a digital circuit block that implements the Hamming code. It will consist of an encoder that encodes 4-bit data inputs into 8-bit code-words, and a decoder that will receive 8-bit codewords to detect and correct single-bit errors. It will also be able to detect 2-bit errors.
